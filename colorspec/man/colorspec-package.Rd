\title{colorspec: Visual Modeling}
\description{
colorspec is an R package designed to facilitate the analysis of visual perception in fiddler crabs, peafowl, and bluetits using the Receptor Noise Limited (RNL) model. The package provides tools for calculating chromatic and achromatic contrast in Just Noticeable Difference (JND) units, allowing researchers to quantify color contrast as perceived by these species under different lighting conditions. The visual model parameters are based on published studies, and the package leverages the pavo package for spectral data processing.
