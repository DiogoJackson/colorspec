# colorspec

It processes and plots aggregated rspecdata reflectances with a pattern. Additionally, the vismodel parameters were compiled to three functions. These functions can easily simulate bluetit, fiddler crab and peafowl visions, and gives a table with Qi and JND together as results.

All these functions are based on 'pavo' package.
